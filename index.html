        <h2>About TechSAV</h2>
        <p>TechSAV is a community of tech, tech-curious, and remote workers in Savannah, GA.  We exist to help grow the tech community, give remote workers a place to meet fellow dorks, geeks and nerds, and to give folks who are tech curious an easy path to getting into tech!</p>
        <p>COVID slowed us down a lot. We haven't been able to restart all of our programs yet, but we do have an active community on Slack and hold monthly happy hours on Meetup!</p>

        <p>Want to get involved?  <a href="">Join the meetup</a>!  As part of that process, you can let us know you'd like to join us in Slack, and we'll send you an invite!</p>
        <p>We're working towards getting coding classes going again, and there's usually some kind of trouble brewing in Slack, so stay tuned!</p>
